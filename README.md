# Cloud Rendering

This will be my documentation for learning how to render realistic clouds in unity. For some context, I know absolulutly nothing, but I want to change that, so here I am.

So far what I've found is that ray marching is super important when trying to do this, so I'll need to look into what that is (I already have a vague idea, but my understanding is completely surface level)
